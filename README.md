HELLO! 

I found a free dataset from Kaggle.com on olympic data and decided to play around and manipulate this data to:
A) Find the answers to some questions about the dataset that popped up in my head as I was looking at it
B) Practice SQL querying

The dataset includes 15 fields and over tens of thousands of records. Because of this high number of records, I decided
it would be interesting to handle this data. 

The fields include: 
1) id
2) name
3) sex
4) age
5) height
6) weight
7) team
8) noc
9) games
10) year
11) season
12) city
13) sport
14) event
15) medal

I included comments in the SQL script to help guide readers with my train of thought as I tackled this dataset.
Some of the queries in this SQL script vary in difficulty. I utilize basic SQL functions and features like...

1) COUNT
2) SUM
3) MIN
4) MAX

... to answer basic questions like:

1) How many records are in this dataset
2) What are the earliest and latest olympic years recorded in this dataset
3) etc

I also use some intermediate SQL language and syntax to find result tables for complex questions like:
1) How many of each type of olympic medal have been won by different age groups
2) How many of each type of olympic medal have been won by each participating country
3) How many of each type of olympic medal have been won by a woman throughout the entire recorded history of the Olympic games?

I hope this is helpful!!!
